Google Apps Admin SDK Reports API -> Graphite
============================

Google has deprecated the Google Apps Reporting API (https://developers.google.com/google-apps/reporting/)
in favor of the new Admin SDK Reports API (https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/).

The scripts in this repo help you use a Google Apps domain admin account to
enable access to, query the Reports API for your domain, and send the output
to a Graphite instance.
